# LibretroRT & RetriX

LibretroRT is a framework to enable porting of Libretro cores to WinRT components.

This should enable creating native UWP emulator front ends using high the high quality open source Libretro cores available.

## Help wanted

I am accepting donations on [gofundme](https://www.gofundme.com/retrix) to help with development costs.
At minimum, I would need:

- An Authenticode certificate to do binary releases
- An Xbox One to develop/test on

## Installing

1. Check the [releases](https://github.com/Aftnet/LibretroRT/releases) section for the latest binary build
2. If installing for the first time, download the [RetriX.Certificate.cer](https://github.com/Aftnet/LibretroRT/releases/download/Initial/RetriX.Certificate.cer), also linked in the releases section, and install it in the local or machine trusted CA store. Instructions for doing so [here](http://www.sqlservermart.com/HowTo/Windows_Import_Certificate.aspx)
3. Download and double click on the .appxbundle file, follow the instructions

## Building from source

The project makes extensive use of [Git submodules](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule), to include Libretro cores code, which means some extra care needs to be taken when cloning.

1. Do a *recursive* clone (add `--recursive` after `git clone`). Or just clone from Team Explorer in Visual Studio
2. Select either x86, x64 or ARM as the architecture, `Any CPU` won't work, then your preferred build config (Debug/Release)
3. Select `Retrix.UWP` as the startup project in Visual Studio to run from there with debugger attached
4. Right click on the Retrix.UWP node in solution explorer, select Store->Create app packages and follow the wizard to create your own .appx binaries

## Design goals

- Full compliance with UWP sandboxing
- Having cores render to SwapChain panels, allowing [XAML and DirectX interop](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/gaming/directx-and-xaml-interop) and front ends to use native UWP controls for the UI
- Support Windows 10 on all platforms (Desktop, Mobile, Xbox, VR) and architectures (x86, x64, ARM)
- Allow packaging and distribution via NuGet for a great development experience

## Project aim

- Creating a UWP Libretro front end for a better experience (proper DPI scaling, native look and feel, fullscreen as borderless window, integration with Windows's modern audio pipeline)
- Increasing safety by having emulation code run sandboxed
- Create a meaningful use case for UWP sideloading on Windows, since Microsoft has decided to ban emulators from the store

## Current state

- Created a framework to speed up porting of software rendering based Libretro cores to WinRT components
- Ported GenesisPlusGX, Snes9x, FCEUMM, Nestopia (doesn't work well, using FCEUMM instead), VBAM, Ganbatte (unstable)
- Created audio player WinRT components to interop between Libretro's audio rendering interface and Windows 10's [AudioGraph](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/audio-video-camera/audio-graphs) API
- Created input manager WinRT component to interop between Libretro's input polling interface and Windows 10's [Gamepad APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.gaming.input.gamepad)
- Created [Win2D](https://github.com/Microsoft/Win2D) based video renderer. Supports software based Libretro cores.
- Created RetriX, a native XAML based Libretro front end, with an UI optimized for mouse, touch as well as gamepad interaction: it scales from phones to tablets, traditional PC form factors as well as the Xbox One.
- Implemented a way to virtualize file system access from within cores: allows opening zipped games and those made up of multiple files
- Added support for some CD based game systems: Mega CD and PlayStation

## Roadmap

- Expand framework to allow porting of OpenGL based cores to WinRT using [Angle](https://github.com/Microsoft/angle) while still allowing front ends to be written in languages other than C++
- Port more Libretro cores
- Split LibretroRT (Libretro core ports to UWP) from RetriX, distribute the former via Nuget package, the latter via direct appx downlad in addition to source availability
- Create signed appx packages with a valid Authenticode certificate to make installation as easy as traditional desktop apps
- Complete Xbox UI (create an in game menu to allow for saving/loading and quitting game without quitting RetriX)
